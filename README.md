# Drug-synergy-calculator
In drug synergy experiment, we examine effectiveness of combination treatment of drugs against cells (e.g. cancer cells) compared to treatment with its single components. This project works like a calculator to analyze drug synergy data and generate heat map and bar graph with statistical analysis.
